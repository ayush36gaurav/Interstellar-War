# Interstellar-War

It's the year 3722, our galaxy has been taken over by a Type-II Civilization. Humans either serve as slaves or fight as a rebel, you have recently joined the ReBel group. The crew is short on supplies, your data science skills are needed to help the crew find someone wealthy to loot them.

We are in deep space and have received transmission from 4 light years away and things arenâ€™t looking good. To save yourself and the crew, you are challenged to predict which person should be robbed using data of Type-II civilization received from the transmission.

Help save them and change history!
